2. **Fill out the form** with relevant information such as soil nutrients, weather conditions, and rainfall. To predict the most suitable crop for a given set of conditions, the application requires the following significant features:  

   - Nitrogen (N) content in soil  
   - Phosphorous (P) content in soil  
   - Potassium (K) content in soil  
   - Temperature (Â°C)  
   - Humidity (%)  
   - pH value of the soil  
   - Rainfall (mm)  

3. **Click the "Submit" button** to generate the prediction result.  

4. **View the prediction result** to see the recommended crop based on the input conditions.
